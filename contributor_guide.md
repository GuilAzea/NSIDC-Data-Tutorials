# How to Contribute

## Overview

We welcome contributions in many forms;  
- Fix typos
- New tutorials
- Add documentation
- Suggest new approaches
- Update methods

If you are not part of NSIDC please follow a __Forking Workflow__.  If you are part of NSIDC, you can follow a __Forking Workflow__ or follow a standard __Git Workflow__.

We follow the __git workflow__ described [here](https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/).
This is a __Forking Workflow__.  This is fundamentally different from other workflows in
that `nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials` repository is _Forked_ creating a "copy" under a user's
private repository; e.g. `user/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials`.  This "copy" is just a `git clone` of
`nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials`.  Contributors follow a branching workflow; create a branch,
do some work, commit the changes, and push work to their private repository
(`user/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials`).  They then create a pull request, which, once approved, is
merged into the central `nsidc/NSIDC-Data-Tutorials`.

This approach allows contributions from outside of NSIDC.

A more in depth discussion of the __Forking Workflow__ can be found
[here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)

A recipe for contributing is given below.
