    "\n",
    "#### Webinar Outline\n",
    "* Intro of harmonization challenge\n",
    "    - Moving one level deeper into the need for time series analysis across disparate platforms\n",
    "* Intro to the altimetry missions\n",
    "    - Use the IceFlow intro notebook to guide this\n",
    "    - Highlight the impressive time series\n",
    "* Overview of IceFlow and icepyx\n",
    "    - Audience and use cases of these tools\n",
    "    - Icepyx genesis, open science and community development principles\n",
    "        - working on that balance between community development and end use\n",
    "    - IceFlow overview\n",
    "    - How do these tools address challenges\n",
    "        - IceFlow aims to make it easier to harmonize OIB/ICESat data with ICESat-2 using backend IceFlow API\n",
    "* Use Case / Application\n",
    "    - Leverage ICESat-2 hackweek topics\n",
    "    - https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/geospatial-analysis/blob/master/shean_ICESat-2_hackweek_tutorial_GeospatialAnalysis.ipynb\n",
    "* Short navigation of nsidc site, how to get to tools, notebook\n",
    "    - Have Jennifer post links while we talk.\n",
    "* Demos\n",
    "    - **Use this notebook to pulls pieces of iceflow / icepyx using a specific science application**"
