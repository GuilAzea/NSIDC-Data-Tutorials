## Glacier Tutorial
This tutorial demonstrates how to access, download, spatially subset and visualize the following two glacier data sets available from NSIDC:
MEaSUREs Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) Digital Elevation Model from GeoEye and WorldView Imagery
MEaSUREs Greenland Ice Velocity: Selected Glacier Site Velocity Maps from InSAR

It demonstrates how to use a shapefile or other vector-based spatial data formats to search for data within an area and download the appropriate DEM and velocity data. Then, the DEM will be spatially subset based on the extent of the velocity file and then both files will be plotted.
