# Snow Depth and Snow Cover Data Exploration 

## Summary 

This tutorial demonstrates how to access and compare coincident snow data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC DAAC) across in-situ, airborne, and satellite platforms from NASA's SnowEx, ASO, and MODIS data sets, respectively.  

## Key Learning Objectives

1. Learn about the coverage, resolution, and structure of snow data sets from NASA's SnowEx, ASO, and MODIS data sets. 

2. Learn how to find and download spatiotemporally coincident data across in-situ, airborne, and satellite observations.

3. Learn how to read data into Python from CSV and GeoTIFF formats.

4. Learn how to subset data based on a buffered area. 

5. Learn how to extract and visualize raster values at point locations.
