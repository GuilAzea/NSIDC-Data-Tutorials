Getting the most out of NSIDC DAAC data: Discovering, Accessing, and Harmonizing Arctic Remote Sensing Data

This tutorial demonstrates the NSIDC DAAC's data discovery, access, and subsetting services, along with basic open source resources used to harmonize and analyze data across multiple products. The tutorial is provided as a series of Python-based Jupyter Notebooks, focusing on sea ice height and ice surface temperature data from NASAâ€™s ICESat-2 and MODIS missions, respectively, to characterize Arctic sea ice. 


Learning Objectives:

1. Learn about the coverage, resolution, and structure of snow data sets from NASA's SnowEx, ASO, and VIIRS data sets. 

2. Learn how to find and download spatiotemporally coincident data across in-situ, airborne, and satellite observations.

3. Learn how to read data into Python from CSV, GeoTIFF, and HDF-EOS formats.

4. Learn how to extract and compare raster values at point locations.
